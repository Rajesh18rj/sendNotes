## Benefits of Writing This Relationship

### 1. Easy Querying
   Instead of manually writing a query like:
```php
$notes = Note::where('user_id', $user->id)->get();
```
You can simply use:
```php
$notes = $user->notes;
```
## This makes your code cleaner and more readable.

### 2. Eloquent Relationship Methods
   You can do powerful operations with relationships, such as:

- (a) Retrieve All Notes of a User
```php
$user = User::find(1);
$notes = $user->notes;  // Gets all notes of user with ID 1
```
- (b) Create a New Note for a User
```php
$user->notes()->create([
'content' => 'This is a new note!',
]);
Laravel automatically fills the user_id field in the notes table for you.
```
- (c) Get a User's Notes with Eager Loading (Performance Boost)
```php
$users = User::with('notes')->get();
```
This prevents the N+1 query problem by loading all related notes in a single query.

### 3. Automatic Relationship Handling
   If you delete a user, all their notes will also be deleted (if cascadeOnDelete is enabled).
   You donâ€™t need to manually write queries to manage relations.

# Get started on views 

```bash
composer require wireui/wireui 
```
install this .. 

then add this tag in header file
<wireui:scripts />  (add this in layout file)

```css
"./vendor/wireui/wireui/src/*.php",
"./vendor/wireui/wireui/ts/**/*.ts",
"./vendor/wireui/wireui/src/WireUi/**/*.php",
"./vendor/wireui/wireui/src/Components/**/*.php",
```
then add this tailwindcss content .. 

then add this preset also in tailwind.config
```css
presets: [
...
require("./vendor/wireui/wireui/tailwind.config.js")
],
```
then we need to publish this . 


then we can use like this  
```html
<x-button primary>Hi there</x-button>
```
refer those colors in wire ui docs page ... 

if we want to modify the color we can do it..
```css
primary: colors.indigo,
secondary: colors.gray,
positive: colors.emerald,
negative: colors.red,
warning: colors.amber,
info: colors.blue
```
these are custom color if we want we can change it in tailwind.config ..

for example we change the primary color to rose 

go to tailwind.config

```css
extend: {
    colors: {
        primary: colors.rose,
},
```
then make sure import this in tailwindcss upper

const colors = require('tailwindcss/colors')

now its working perfectly.. 

then go to navigation page and copy dashboard nav link and paste it and change the name into notes .. 

then create a route for notes .. 

then create a notes.index in view 

notes ellathaiyum list panni inga than kaata porom..

then we need a livewire component for notes

if we want to create a new column in previously existsing notes table
>  php artisan make:migration add_recipient_to_notes_table --table=notes

then this comment create a new table 
you can add this in that table             - $table->string('recipient');

then do 
 > php artisan migrate:rollback
 
now recipient column add to the notes table .. 


# next we can do is 

only auth users can only delete posts 
that's why we are going to policy

>  php artisan make:policy NotePolicy --model=Note

then first go to show-notes page 

$this->authorize('delete',$note);  #add this line before delete 

then go to policy , write like this

public function delete(User $user, Note $note): bool
    {
        return $user->id === $note->user_id;
    }

Now that authenticated user only can delete that note.. 

then we are going to create edit page
>  php artisan make:volt notes/edit-note --class

then create the route for this 


we can also do Policy for edit too.. 

then we are going to create fake data or real data for factory and seeder

then we create show notes 

then if pages are getting load we are going to add a spinner 

add this function in show-notes

    public function placeholder(): string
        {
        return <<<'HTML'
        <div role="status">

        <span class="sr-only">Loading...</span>
        </div>
        HTML;
        }

then add this lazy keyword in index blade file

<livewire:notes.show-notes lazy />
